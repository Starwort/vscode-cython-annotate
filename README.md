# vscode-cython-annotate

See cython annotation (a.k.a "cython -a") right in vscode!

## Features

This is a very preliminary version, and this extension is pretty much still WIP.
Currently only color coding is supported.
To show them, use the "Cython: annotate" command while in your editor to show the annotations (and update after editing the file).
Use "Cython: Clear annotations" to remove.

## Extension Settings

* `cython-annotate.condaEnv`: Name of conda path to run cython within

## Roadmap

* Cache results
* Produce annotations automatically

## Release Notes
